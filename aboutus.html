                The Vehicle Recall Check was born out of a families grief over a fatal engine fault. It is designed to ensure you receive information on your terms, with nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, nothing hidden that will not be made known*1 .   Enter your vehicle registration and VRC will search the DVLA's database regularly and alert you to potentially dangerous faults.   You can use our quick search facility to check recalls on a car your thinking of buying or better still, ensure the car you are selling has a clean bill of health, before it becomes, literally, someone else's problem.  It is important to realise that it is the manufactures responsibility, to let you know about a fault with your vehicle, we are just aiming to assist in the "letting you know bit" and it will take a great deal of courage on behalf of the manufacturers to recognise this app is in everyone's best interest. So would withholding your MOT* until the recall had been completed ...  But that's a battle for another day.....   *1. Luke 12.2 *2. Use our Reminders page to set Mot and Road tax dates... Insurance too if you don't already get     reminded to bits!
